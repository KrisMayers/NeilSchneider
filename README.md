#### Notes for when adding albums/EPs/singles

- Release artwork images must be 750px x 750px to keep the styling consistent, it went kinda weird otherwise even though I tried to set it so it shouldn't. Use Squoosh.app and convert to a WEBP file to keep it small. Try keep it under 100kb with the best quality possible so it doesn't take forever to load on crappy bandwidths.

- FYI: EPs filter button is currently commented out cos I don't know if there are any yet.
